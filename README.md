The directory LCD6 should be copied to:
<Energia directory>\energia-0101E0016\hardware\msp430\libraries

Pay attention that if the library will be copied to 
..\Documents\Energia\libraries
it may stuck the Energia and it will not load, because there is an Energia bug that prevents loading examples from that directory.

Goto Examples --> LCD6demo to see the functionality of the library.
